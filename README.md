### Why aren't more women R users? 

The "heR Panel Discussion and Mixer" will be an opportunity for useR!
attendees to discuss the shortage of women in the R development community and whether gender makes a difference for software development. 

The event will be held from **5:30 to 7pm on July 1 (Venue TBD)**. A distinguished panel of developers and statisticians will take questions from the
audience on the topic of gender and statistical software development. The panel
discussion will be followed by a social mixer. _All conference attendees are welcome._
